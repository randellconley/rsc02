intent_classification_task:
  description: >
    As the Project Orchestrator, analyze the ENHANCED user request (with operator context) to determine intent and route to appropriate workflow:
    
    Enhanced Request: {topic}
    Operator Context: {operator_context}
    Technical Background: {technical_background}
    Project Context: {project_context}
    Complexity Preference: {complexity_preference}
    Q&A Dialogue: {qa_dialogue}
    Unstated Needs: {unstated_needs}
    Execution Context: {execution_context}
    Current Year: {current_year}
    
    Now classify with full operator context into:
    
    1. INFORMATION REQUEST - Operator wants to learn, understand, or get explanations
    2. PLANNING REQUEST - Operator wants strategic advice, recommendations, or planning  
    3. IMPLEMENTATION REQUEST - Operator wants something built, created, or implemented
    
    Consider the operator's experience level, context, and true intentions when classifying.
    Use the operator context to tailor the workflow to their specific needs and preferences.
  expected_output: >
    Enhanced intent classification with operator context:
    
    INTENT: [INFORMATION/PLANNING/IMPLEMENTATION]
    CONFIDENCE: [High/Medium/Low]
    REASONING: Classification reasoning considering operator context
    OPERATOR-AWARE WORKFLOW: [Workflow tailored to operator's needs and experience level]
    
    Route to appropriate workflow with full operator context available to all agents.
    All subsequent agents should consider the operator's technical background, project context, 
    complexity preferences, and identified unstated needs.
