# Provider Configuration Fixes

## Summary

The initial green checkmarks (✅) in `python model_manager_cli.py status` only indicated that **API keys were found in environment variables**, not that the APIs were actually reachable and functional.

After implementing full connectivity testing, we discovered and fixed configuration issues for Gemini and DeepSeek.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Gemini Configuration Issue

**Problem:** 
- Model identifier `gemini-1.5-pro` was causing authentication errors
- LiteLLM was trying to use Google Cloud credentials instead of API key

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Before (incorrect)
gemini:
  model: gemini-1.5-pro

# After (correct)  
gemini:
  model: gemini/gemini-1.5-pro
```

**Explanation:** LiteLLM requires the provider prefix `gemini/` to properly route API calls and use the correct authentication method.

### 2. DeepSeek Configuration Issue

**Problem:**
- Model identifier `deepseek-chat` was not recognized by LiteLLM
- Error: "LLM Provider NOT provided"

**Solution:**
```yaml
# Before (incorrect)
deepseek:
  model: deepseek-chat

# After (correct)
deepseek:
  model: deepseek/deepseek-chat  
```

**Explanation:** LiteLLM requires the provider prefix `deepseek/` to identify the correct provider for the model.

## Current Working Configuration

All providers now working correctly:

```yaml
providers:
  claude:
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  # ✅ Works as-is
    api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    
  gemini:
    model: gemini/gemini-1.5-pro      # ✅ Fixed with prefix
    api_key_env: GEMINI_API_KEY
    
  openai:
    model: gpt-4o                     # ✅ Works as-is
    api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
    
  deepseek:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-chat     # ✅ Fixed with prefix
    api_key_env: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
```

## Enhanced Status Command

The status command now automatically tests API connectivity:

```bash
python model_manager_cli.py status
```

**Output Example:**
```
📊 Provider Status:
🧪 Testing API connectivity...
  CLAUDE: 🔑 ✅ Operational
  GEMINI: 🔑 ✅ Operational  
  OPENAI: 🔑 ✅ Operational
  DEEPSEEK: 🔑 ✅ Operational
```

## Status Indicators Explained

- **🔑** = API key found in environment variables
- **✅** = API key found AND API responding correctly
- **❌** = API key missing OR API not responding
- **⏭️** = Skipped testing (no API key provided)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Green checkmarks initially only meant API keys were present**, not functional
2. **LiteLLM requires provider prefixes** for some models (Gemini, DeepSeek)
3. **Full connectivity testing** is now built into the default status command
4. **All 4 providers are now operational** with correct configuration

## Testing Your Setup

To verify your providers are working:

1. Ensure all API keys are in your `.env` file
2. Run: `python model_manager_cli.py status`
3. Look for `🔑 ✅ Operational` for each provider
4. If you see `❌`, check the error message for specific issues

## Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "API key not found" | Missing environment variable | Add API key to `.env` |
| "Invalid API key" | Wrong/expired API key | Update API key |
| "LLM Provider NOT provided" | Missing provider prefix | Add provider prefix (e.g., `deepseek/`) |
| "Default credentials not found" | Wrong auth method | Use provider prefix format |

The system now provides real-time connectivity testing to ensure all providers are truly operational, not just configured.
